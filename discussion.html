                    By ExplorerJane: "I just finished reading Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days, and I'm completely fascinated by Phileas Fogg’s journey! His calm demeanor in the face of all those challenges is remarkable. But what do you all think about his character? Do you feel like he was driven more by pride or the thrill of adventure? Also, what are your thoughts on Passepartout’s role? For me, his moments of naivety balanced out Fogg’s serious nature perfectly. I'd love to hear everyone's interpretation of their dynamic! Oh, and if you could take a journey around the world like Fogg, where would you want to visit first?"
